#Train the model
After the definition of the location of train, val and test, the number of classes (NC) and the names oh√¨f the classes is it possible to train the model.
Since the dataset is small, and it is not possible to know how many object per image there are, it is used the smallest of pretrained models yolov5 to keep simple and avoid overfitting

#Inference
After the generation of the new weights it is possible to run detect.py in order to test the new model and do inference
